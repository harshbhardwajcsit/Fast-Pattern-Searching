# Fast-Pattern-Searching
An algorithm to search a pattern and its all permutation in a text, the algorithms search pattern in O(length of text) which is quite good  than the Rabin-karp algo and is comparative to KMP pattern searching algo in terms of time complexity , the algorithm use a Pattern hashmap and a temp. hashmap to generate results , with extra O(length of pattern)
